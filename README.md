# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads React project for the Front-End NanoDegree. This project uses components and stateless componentes to organize and rearrange books on a virtual book case. It also provides has an option to search for new books on a Udacity Built API. When a book is already on your shelf, the "changer" in search results will reflect that. I also use React Router to manage the address bar and the ensure proper url as well as back button functionality


## Getting it setup locally

I've set this up with create-react-app so in order to get this running on your local enviornment you'll just need to clone this repo. 

Once it's installed locally, go to the directory it's located in, run "npm install" to install all dependencies. Once those are installed simply run "npm start" and this will run a local server on your machine. 

Alternitavely I've deployed this site to GitHub Pages and you can reach it at this <a href="https://enos-16.github.io/FEND-MyReads/" target="_blank">address</a>.
